### Envato Tuts+ Course: Start Here: Learn CSS Typography
#### Instructor: Kezz Bracey

If there’s one kind of styling that’s more important than any other in web design, it’s typography. Why? Because a huge portion of the time visitors spend on the sites you create will be spent reading, so it’s your job as a designer to make that time comfortable and enjoyable. Ideally, your sites should begin with solid typography, then the rest of the design should be built around it, so it’s important to understand this portion of the design process first.

In this package you’ll find all the code seen in the demonstrations throughout the course.
